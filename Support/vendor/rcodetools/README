= Overview
rcodetools is a collection of Ruby code manipulation tools. 
It includes xmpfilter and editor-independent Ruby development helper tools,
as well as emacs and vim interfaces.

Currently, rcodetools comprises:
* xmpfilter: Automagic Test::Unit assertions/RSpec expectations and code annotations
* rct-complete: Accurate method/class/constant etc. completions
* rct-doc: Document browsing and code navigator
* rct-meth-args: Precise method info (meta-prog. aware) and TAGS generation

See also README.xmpfilter.

Originally rct-complete and rct-doc were subcommands of xmpfilter.
Actually they use xmpfilter's code heavily.
But the relationship between xmpfilter (annotation) and completion/doc is not
intuitive, so I (rubikitch) split it into separate executables.

= Usage
xmpfilter, rct-complete and rct-doc take its input from stdin and write to
stdout. They can run in several modes; see 
 xmpfilter -h 
 rct-complete -h 
 rct-doc -h 
README.emacs and README.vim describe how to use rcodetools from your editor.

= License
rcodetools is licensed under the same terms as Ruby.
